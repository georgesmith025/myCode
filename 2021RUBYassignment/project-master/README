To access the project, change directory to the 'project' directory.
For example:
- cd ~/workspace/project

Before opening the project, please make sure all of the ruby gems for the website are installed (once already in the directory) by using the following 
in the command line:
- bundle install

To then run the website, on the command line use the following:
- ruby app.rb

To then access the website (on a different tab/window), type in the URL in the following format:
- https://<box-name>-<port-number>.codio.io/
Most of the time, the default port number is 4567, if any different this is told to you once you run app.rb
For example, my box name is 'alpha-section' and my port number is '4567' which would equate to:
- https://alpha-section-4567.codio.io/

Once done visiting the website, on the terminal, please use the following keys to stop the broadcast:
-Ctrl + C (simultaneously)
