                    Hello, my is George Smith and this is the website I have
                    designed and implemented for my COM1008 autumn semester
                    assignment. Each page displays a certain skill in
                    web-design. I.E. This page is simple so loads very
                    quickly, the degree page has text and images set in a
                    changing layout depending on screen size, the quiz
                    page uses javaScript to function, the canvas page
                    is quite self explanatory and an example of using
                    as html canvas controlled by javaScript, the contacts 
                    page provides contact infomation, and the accessibility 
                    page contains an accessibility statement for the website.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In any website keeping the attention of the user is very 
                    important, however, I chose a very calm colour scheme 
                    and these images are surrounded by a wall of text. So 
                    this presents a problem, how to grab the user's 
                    attention? Easy, on the left is a picture of my dog, 
                    Archie. How better to draw the eye of the user than a 
                    cute ginger cockaspaniel. He is from a family of gun 
                    dogs for the moors of swaledale where grouse shoots 
                    take place every year. So I, like many young people 
                    in the North Yorkshire countryside, go grouse beating
                    on the moorland for money and for fun and to hang out 
                    with a truckload of eager dogs. This attracts shooters 
                    from all over the world for a day out.
